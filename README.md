# TaskFlow 

TaskFlow is a web app for managing tasks (mainly tasks related to web development projects, but it can be used for any tasks) and monitoring your progress in completing the tasks that you create for yourself. 

## Key Features 

- Creating New Tasks: you can create new tasks by providing a title, a description, the type of the task and a deadline data for the said task
- Progress Visualization: you can visualize the percentage of tasks that you have completed out of the total number of tasks for each type
- Finishing and Deleting: ability to delete tasks completely or to mark them as finished
- Filtering: filter tasks based on their type or sort them based on the deadline

## Technologies Used 

- HTML5
- SCSS 
- JavaScript

## Architecture 

Implemented the MVC architecture where I have used a model to manage the business logic of the application, multiple views to build up the user interface and a controller to create a bridge in between the model and the views
